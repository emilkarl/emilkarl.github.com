A while ago I watched an amazing video of some french dudes base jumping and walking a slackline between two mountain tops. It had a great feel to it and the light and colors in the video was great. The full length movie is called _I Believe I Can Fly_ and this was the trailer for it.

Today I did a little research and found that the filmers name is _Sebastien Montaz-Rosset_. Check out his [Vimeo channel](http://vimeo.com/chamonix) and his [website](http://www.sebmontaz.com/). A lot of beautiful videos captured in the alps!
