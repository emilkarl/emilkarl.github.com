I'm a climbing web developer living in Linkรถping, Sweden. When I'm not at the office or visiting a 
client I like to climb the walls in the gym, mountain biking or watch the latest episode of _The Office_.

I work as a web developer at [Noc Webbyrรฅ](http://nocweb.se). I do things like _Ruby on Rails_, _PHP_, _SQL_ and _HTML/CSS/JS_ and stuff in those areas. Even though I prefer working with *Ruby on Rails* I've done a number of projects in [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) and [Drupal](http://drupal.org) during the last couple of years.
