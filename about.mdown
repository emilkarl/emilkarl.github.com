I'm a climbing web developer living in Linköping, Sweden. When I'm not at the office or visiting a 
client I like to climb the cliffs around Linköping, go for a hike or watch the latest episode of _The Office_.

I'm a web developer at [Noc Webbyrå](http://nocweb.se) and do things like _Ruby on Rails_, _PHP_, _SQL_ and _HTML/CSS/JS_ and more. Even though I prefer working with *Ruby on Rails* I've done a number of projects in [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) and [Drupal](http://drupal.org) during the last couple of years.
