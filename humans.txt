/* HUMANS.TXT? */

	What is humans.txt?
	  It's an initiative for knowing the people behind a website.
	  It's a TXT file that contains information about the different
	  people who have contributed to building the website.

	Why a TXT?
	  Because it's something simple and fast to create.
	  Because it's not intrusive with the code. More often than not, 
	  the owners of the site don't like the authors signing it; they
	  claim that doing so may make the site less efficient. By adding
	  a txt file, you can prove your authorship (not your property) 
	  in an external, fast, easy and accessible way.
